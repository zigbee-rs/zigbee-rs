The **ZigBee protocol stack** & **ZigBee Cluster Library** in `no_std` to integrate ZigBee communication into an application.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Zigbee is a wireless communication technology designed for low-power devices in smart homes and industrial settings. 

It enables these devices to connect and communicate with each other, allowing for efficient control and automation of various systems.


## ZigBee

This crate aims to fully implement the [ZigBee specification 22 1.0](https://csa-iot.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/docs-05-3474-22-0csg-zigbee-specification-1.pdf)

## Zigbee Cluster Library

This crate defines a set of standard clusters (collection of commands and attributes) that enable interoperable communication between devices in a Zigbee network based on the [ZigBee Cluster Library Rev 6 Draft 1.0](https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/07-5123-06-zigbee-cluster-library-specification.pdf)
